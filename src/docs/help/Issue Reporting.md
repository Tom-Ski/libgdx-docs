<h1>Issue Reporting</h1>

Found a bug? Great, we'd love to hear about it.

<div class="well info">
Please note the issue tracker isn't for personal assistance, if you have a problem that isn't a reproducable bug in the core framework, please
use the [community help](Community Help.html) for assistance.
</div>

Before you report the issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues) we ask you to do a few things:

- Verify that the task hasn't already been reported on the tracker
- Make sure the bug hasn't already been fixed, use the latest SNAPSHOT of LibGDX to latest
- Create a [self contained example](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help#executable-example-code) to demonstrate the issue. Don't hack a project down, start fresh to reproduce the error.


Once you have done this, please submit this along with any stacktraces or assets to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues), whilst filling out the template that is shown when creating a new issue.

<br>

If the issue submitted is invalid, such as the template being ignored, or not providing reproduction steps (no matter how easy it might seem to you), the
issue will most likely be closed.  There is a limited amount of time contributors have, and incomplete issues make it very time consuming and difficult to diagnose
and try to fix.
