<h1>Introduction to LibGDX</h1>

LibGDX is a relatively low level, free, open source cross platform game development framework.
The goal of the project is to assist you in creating games/applications and deploy to desktop and mobile
platforms without getting in the way and letting you design however you like.

LibGDX is free, licensed with Apache 2 open source software license, allowing everyone to use this project.


There are plenty of higher level tools in the framework to get you started quickly, and there is full access 
to low level API if and when you need to use them.

Below is the quick start guide series to get you started with LibGDX with your specific environment, so get clicking!
